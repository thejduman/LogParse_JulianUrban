# LogParse_JulianUrban
For my project I will be developing a program that can parse log files and visualize statistics from those log files. I will collect data from the SEC.gov internet log files. I will create a Python program that can extract the fields from the log files and organize them in data structures. The Python program will also be able to use the IP-API (https://ip-api.com/) to lookup geolocation information for IP addresses. I will use the D3.js framework to perform visualization of the extracted data from the log files. The final program should be able to take the log file, parse the data, and create visual summaries of the data.
