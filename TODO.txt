- Integrate IP API
Goal: get regionName for each IP address in the ip column of dataframe
Steps to take:
- Create a function that allows me to pass in an IP value to get an API response
- Create a test dataframe of ip addresses
- Create a loop to get the regionName
    - Check X-Rl to see if a request can be made
    - If so, make an API request with the current IP address
    - Else, wait until X-ttl == 0
